# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the Transformer Translation Visualizer application.

To add screenshots:
1. Take screenshots of your application in action
2. Save them in this directory with descriptive names (e.g., `tokenization_view.png`, `attention_visualization.png`)
3. Update the main README.md file to reference these screenshots

Screenshots help users understand what your application looks like and how it functions before they install it.
